# About

This is a usecase for the models and metric results files used in the journal paper **"Cognitive Digital Thread Tool-chain for Model Versioning in Model-Based Systems Engineering"**

# Description

The metamodels and models of landing gear systems can be found in model library file named **LGS.metag**, which includes tailored modeling library for SysML and Simulink.

The original results of metrics can be found in files named **our tool-chain.mrf** and **git-based approach.mrf**, which is record by free mouse record tool (available: https://www.mouserecorder.com/index.html).

More details of this paper can be found in the manuscript file **manuscript.pdf** in PDF format.
