# About

This is usecase for Codegeneration.

# Description

This is a code generation case in the MBSE field, mainly for the conversion of IMF model to AASX model. AAS is a widely adopted specification for digital representation of assets. MBSE represents asset information with data models, and physical asset information is widely accepted. Through the code generation technology in model conversion, the model in system engineering is converted into a real digital asset to achieve digital delivery.
