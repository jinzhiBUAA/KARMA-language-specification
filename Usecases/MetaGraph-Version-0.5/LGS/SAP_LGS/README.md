# About

This is a usecase for the models and load simulation of landing gear retraction actuator.

# Description

The metamodels and models of landing gear systems can be found in model library folder named **SAP_LGS**, which includes tailored modeling library for SysML and Simulink.

The load simulation of landing gear retraction actuator can be found under the folder **SAP_LGS**, named **lgs_retract_20240508.slx**, which is supported by MATLAB/Simulink.

# Status

The models used are supported by MetaGraph version 0.5
