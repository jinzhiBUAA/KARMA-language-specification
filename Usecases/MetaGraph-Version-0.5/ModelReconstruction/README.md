# About

This is usecase for ModelReconstruction.

# Description

This is a case study on the reconstruction of the development process model in the MBSE field, mainly for the reconstruction of the development process of the aircraft airborne maintenance system. During the iterative development of the system, the development process of the old system may not meet the needs of the development of the new system, but it still has reference value. Therefore, this case aims to optimize the process based on the development process of the old version by using algorithms to make it meet the needs of the development of the new system.

# Status

The models used are supported by MetaGraph version 0.5
