# Abstract

Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has been accepted as an extremely important approach to understanding the multi-domain research field comprehensively. In this paper, a bibliometric analysis is used to conduct a comprehensive survey of model-based systems engineering literature of the last five years. The VOSViewer is used to implement visual network analysis for co-authorship, citation, and co-occurrence of the MBSE related papers. The results of the bibliometric study, firstly, reveal the influential research teams and sources. Secondly, research hotspots in the current MBSE domain are identified. The findings of this study aim to help researchers to gain a faster and deeper understanding of the current literature on MBSE.
