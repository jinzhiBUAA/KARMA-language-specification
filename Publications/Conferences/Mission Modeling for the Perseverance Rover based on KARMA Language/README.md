# Abstract

Over the last two decades, Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) has been progressively introduced into the design of complex systems as an essential method, aiming to address the complexity management challenges in traditional document-based approaches. However, limited by a lack of diversity in project and constraints on knowledge, the application of MBSE faces several issues. These include insufficient hierarchical decomposition of missions, overly abstract meta-models, and inadequate adaptability of methods. When MBSE is applied to the rover, the complexity of the Mars environment and the multidisciplinary nature of the Mars roverâ€™s design increase the learning curve for researchers due to the high-level abstraction of the meta-model. This paper proposes a new multi-architecture modeling method based on KARMA language, particularly focusing on the mission and operation stages. Including how to start from client objectives to precisely decompose stakeholder needs and successfully build a conceptual model library, the method supports more accurate and adaptable missions analysis in complex systems. Finally, we use the Perseverance rover design as an example to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
