# Abstract
Model-based Systems Engineering is proposed as a graphical approach to support for-malization of system artifacts across system lifecycle based on models since 1993. The previous motivation of graphical specification is to provide a unified graphical description on the perspective of systems engineering in order to formalize system architectural views, to promote communications among stakeholders and to support system analysis and verification. However, when different modeling tools are developed based on such graphical specifications, model and data interoperability across modeling tools is the biggest challenge faced by the tool venders and MBSE practitioners. Thus, semantic specification is proposed again to enhance data interoperability, such as SysML 2.0 as a possible solution. In this paper, we propose a new semantic MBSE language and framework aiming to support complex system development using a semantic two-core mechanism: 1) KARMA language and 2) Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF) SE and MBSE ontology. Then, we introduce the KARMA Roadmap 2025 including technical vision, organizational views and standardization. A new KARMA open-source modeling environment is planned to being created in order to provide MBSE application for more industrial practitioners.
