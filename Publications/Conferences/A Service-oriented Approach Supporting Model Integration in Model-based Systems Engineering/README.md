# Abstract

When using Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to develop complex systems, models using different syntax and semantics are typically implemented in a heterogeneous environment which leads to difficulties to realize data integrations across the entire lifecycle. Specifically, seamless exchanges between models of different modeling tools are needed to support system lifecycle activities such as requirement analysis, function analysis, verification and validation. This article illustrates a service-oriented approach to support model integration for model-based systems engineering, especially between architecture design and system verification. First, a set of semantic mapping rules between architecture models and simulation models based on Open Service of Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) are proposed to support the formalization of technical resources (models, data, APIs). Then OSLC adapters are developed to transform models, data and APIs into web-based services. The services are deployed by a service discovering plug-in within a specific modeling tool for model information exchange. The approach is illustrated by a case study on KARMA architecture model and Modelica simulation model for a six-degree-of-freedom robot (RobotR3) system. We evaluate the availability and efficiency of this method from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The results show that our approach is effective in model and data integration.
