# Abstract

Constructing and evaluating a comprehensive tool-chain with commercial off-the-shelf and proprietary tools for the deployment of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a challenging and complex task. Specifically, the lack of early assessment during tool-chain development has led to increased research and development costs when unexpected features are developed or poor decisions are made. In this paper, a domain-specific modeling (DSM) approach is proposed to support decision-makings during tool-chain design and to facilitate quantitative assessment of tool-chain features at early-phases. Using this approach, different views of tool-chains are first formalized under a DSM framework. Then the DSM models are transformed to Bayesian network models for supporting the quantitative assessment of related tools in order to analyze the whole tool-chains’ features. In the case study, the approach is verified by comparing two MBSE tool-chains for an auto-braking system design. The results indicate that the DSM approach enhances the understanding of tool-chain concepts, promotes the efficiency of MBSE tool-chain development, and verifies the tool-chain in early development phases using a quantitative approach.
