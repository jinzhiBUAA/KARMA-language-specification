# Abstract

Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is considered an important approach for understanding multidomain fields and is widely used in complex systems such as aerospace. In this
article, a detailed survey ofMBSE literature was conducted from its commencement to the present trends through bibliometric analysis. Some bibliometric tools were used to implement a visual network analysis of MBSE-related manuscripts. The results of the bibliometric study revealed the interrelationship and distribution of researchers in multidomain fields. The authorized sources ofMBSE papers were also assorted. The current practices of MBSE were analyzed. The future directions for MBSE based on the current practices were discussed. We found that MBSE’s research has been conducted by many research teams with distinctive characteristics, and the top publishing sources in this field have emerged. Research on MBSE focuses on system engineering, languages, system of systems, and digitalization. The development of new technologies such as next-generation modeling languages is improving current practical problems. The findings of this study may help researchers gain a faster and more comprehensive understanding of the current and future developments in MBSE.
