# Abstract

 Currently, the fundamental tenets of systems engineering are supported by a model-based approach to minimize risks and avoid design changes in late development stages. The models are used to formalize, analyze, design, optimize, and verify system development and artifacts, helping developers integrate engineering development across domains. Although model-based development is well established in specific domains, such as software, mechanical systems, and electrical systems, its role in integrated development from a system perspective is still a challenge for industry. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tool-chain is an emerging technique in the area of systems engineering and is expected to become a next-generation approach for supporting model integration across domains. This article presents a literature review to highlight the usage and state of the art to generally specify the current understanding of MBSE tool-chain concepts. Moreover, the results are used for identifying the usage, advantages, barriers, concerns, and trends of tool-chain development from an MBSE perspective.
