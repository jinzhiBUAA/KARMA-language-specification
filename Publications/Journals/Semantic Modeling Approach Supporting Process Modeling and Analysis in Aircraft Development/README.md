# Abstract

With the increasing complexity of aircraft development programs, the development processes of aircraft and their subsystems are continuously becoming complicated, leading to the growing risks of development cost across the entire life cycle. In this study, we proposed a model-based systems engineering approach to support process modeling of aircraft development using a multiarchitecture modeling language KARMA. Simultaneously, property verification and hybrid automata simulation were used to implement the static cost analysis of each work task and dynamic cost analysis of the entire development process. Finally, a development process model of aircraft avionics system was created using a case study, in which cost analysis is implemented by the KARMA language. From the result, we found that the KARMA language enables the integration of the process modeling with static and dynamic analyses of the development process in a multi-architecture modeling tool MetaGraph 2.0.
