# Abstract

 Purpose–Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is an important approach for the transforming process
 from “document-centered” to “model centered” systems engineering mode in equipment development, which
 caneffectively shorten the equipment development cycleand improveproductdesignquality. Thispaperaims
 to understand if MBSE enables to support manufacturing and equipment development.
 Design/methodology/approach–ThepaperoptedabibliometricanalysisofMBSEindomainofadvanced
 manufacturing from different perspectives such as publication volume, research team, sources and keyword
 co-occurrence.
 Findings– Firstly, the application of MBSE in advanced manufacturing can be roughly divided into three
 stages. AndMBSEhasbeenwidelyimplementedgloballyandhasgraduallyformedseveralnoteworthyteams.
 Secondly, this article has identified some high-quality sources, with a large number of publications and
 citations, the most influential publications focus on the practice or guidance of digital twins and intelligent
 manufacturing. Thirdly, research can be divided into six categories, including systems engineering,
 digitalization, intelligent manufacturing, product design, model and architecture and MBSE applications.
 Research limitations/implications– Because of the chosen research approach, the visualized network
 tends to lose certain information such as a few keywords may be inaccurately categorized.
 Practical implications– This paper comprehensively study the research status of MBSE in advanced
 manufacturingandforecastsfutureresearchtrends,emphasizingthecombinationofintelligentmanufacturing
 and digitization.
 Originality/value– This paper fulfills an identified need to understand the current application status and
 future development trends of MBSE.
